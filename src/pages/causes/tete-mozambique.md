My people and I live in a remote village in Mozambique, where poverty and lack of basic services hold us back from having a better future. We donâ€™t have reliable healthcare, clean water, or enough resources to grow our economy. With your help, I can access the tools and support needed to improve our living conditions and work towards a more prosperous life.
